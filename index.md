# About

StartHacking.org is a resource to help people start [hacking][hacker].

Right now, the focus is to provide high-quality resources to help hackers
quickly set up development environments and related tools on their machines. In
the future, this site could evolve into pretty much anything -- it's up to the
community.

This guide is kind of like a wiki for hackers -- it's a [community
effort][contribute]. We really appreciate all kinds of contributions, so if
you have anything to add, please [do so][contribute]!

StartHacking.org is [open-source][source].
