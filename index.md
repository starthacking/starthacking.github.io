# StartHacking!

#### What is hacking? :sunglasses:

No, it’s not digitally breaking into banks or other illegal activity,
we’re talking about writing software for fun. [Hacker
culture][hacker] is about making
neat technical projects and learning along the way. Getting started is
hard, so we created this website to help!

#### Is this for me? :thinking:

Whether you’re on your way to a hackathon, or just want to learn about
coding, this website is for you.

StartHacking is an effort to give more people the tools and resources
they need to start building software. Whether you are completely new
to programming or have already attended a few hackathons, StartHacking
can help you learn the skills you need for your next project. From
learning new coding languages to building small projects and mastering
APIs, StartHacking will show you the ropes. Welcome to the world of
hacking!
