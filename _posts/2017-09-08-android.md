# Android App

<p></p>

## Background

Android apps are programmed in Java. If you're new to Java, here are a few tutorials to help you get started!

- If you're new to programming in Java, or you
want an in-depth, involved tutorial that takes you through
Java from the ground up, we recommend
[Codecademy][codecademy]. 
- If you're an expert in several programming languages already, or
you used to know Java and you just need a refresher on the
syntax, check out [Learn X in Y Minutes][xiny]. 
- If you have some experience in Python, you can check out [Java for Python Programmers][java-for-python].
- If you want a comprehensive tutorial of all things Java,
check out [W3Schools][w3schools]. 

Now you're one step closer to making your own Android app!

## Installation

Before you get started, you should make sure that you have JDK 6 or higher. You
can check this by opening up a terminal and running `javac -version`. If
successful, the output should look something like `javac 1.7.0_45`. Anything
greater than `1.6` is fine. Otherewise, you can get JDK [here][jdk-download].

You can install Android Studio by following these steps:

1. Start by downloading Android Studio from the [official site][download].
2. Open the `.dmg` disk image (Mac) or `.exe` installer (Windows).
3. Drag and drop the "Android Studio" icon onto the Applications folder.
4. Go to the Applications folder and open Android Studio.
5. Follow the setup wizard to configure Android Studio.
    1. Choose "Custom" when choosing the type of setup.
    2. Select everything when selecting what components to install.
    3. Use the recommended amount of RAM for HAXM (if applicable).
    4. Agree to all the licenses and click "Finish" to complete 
        configuration.
    5. Wait until all components are downloaded and installed. You
        may need your administrator password to install HAXM.
