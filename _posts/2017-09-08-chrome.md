## <a id="install">Installation</a>



In order to build a Chrome extension, you'll need Google Chrome!
If you haven't downloaded Chrome already, download the latest
version [here][chrome]. For this hackpack, you'll need Chrome
Version 40 or newer. In order to figure out which version you
have, go to [chrome://version/](chrome://version/) in the Omnibar,
and look at the top line. You should see something like

```
Google Chrome	48.0.2564.109 (Official Build) (64-bit)
```

Don't worry if it's not exactly the same. As long as the major
number (before the decimal point) is greater than 40, you're set!

## <a id="background">Background</a>



For this project, you will need some knowledge of Javascript and
Chrome Extensions. The starter code should have sufficient
comments to explain each file, but if you want to get a deeper
understanding of these systems before beginning, we've provided
links to some tutorials below. In particular, if you've never seen
Javascript before, we highly recommend going through a Javascript
tutorial. 

### <a id="javascript">Learn about Javascript</a>



What is JavaScript?

> JavaScript is a scripting language for computers. It is often
> run in web browser applications to create dynamic content like a
> popup message or a live clock. It is not related to the
> programming language Java. \[[source][wiki]\]

Here are a few of our favorite Javascript tutorials!

- If you're an expert in several programming languages already, or
you used to know Javascript and you just need a refresher on the
syntax, check out [Learn X in Y Minutes][xiny]. This tutorial
takes about 10 minutes.
- If you've never seen (or heard of) Javascript before, or you
want an in-depth, involved tutorial that takes you through
Javascript from the ground up, we recommend
[Codecademy][codecademy]. This tutorial takes about 10 hours.
- If you want a comprehensive tutorial of all things Javascript,
check out [W3Schools][w3schools]. This tutorial takes about 10
hours. 

Of course, you're free to find your own tutorials, or learn by
doing.

## <a id="basics">The Basics of Chrome Extensions</a>



What are Chrome Extensions?

> Extensions are small software programs that can modify and
> enhance the functionality of the Chrome browser. You write them
> using web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
> \[[source][extensions]\]

If you want to learn more about Chrome Extensions, read through
Google's [introduction][extensions] to extensions and Google's

## <a id="project">Project: Cal to Butt Chrome Extension</a>



This guide will show you how to build a chrome extension that
replaces the content on webpages according to customizable rules.
At a glance, your tasks will include:

1. Replace all instances of the text "cal" with the text "butt" on
all webpages.
2. Replace all text on a webpage according to user-specified
replacement rules.
3. Replace all images on a website according to user-specified
replacement rules.

After you've finished these tasks, you will have built an exciting
application that you can use in your own browser!

### <a id="start">Getting Started</a>



1. [Clone][clone] or [download][download] the
[starter code][hackpack].

You should roughly have the following files.

```

### Load the Starter Code



Chrome usually ships extensions as `.crx` files (similar to `.zip`
files), which is great for distribution, but not so great for
developing. Instead, we'll tell Chrome to treat the starter code
folder as an extension.

We need to enable Chrome Developer Settings in order to build our
chrome extension.

In order to do this:

1. Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your
browser.
2. Ensure that the **Developer mode** checkbox in the top
right-hand corner is checked.
3. Click **Load unpacked extension...** to pop up a file-selection
dialog.
4. Navigate to the directory in which your extension files live,
and select it.

You should now see a screen that looks like the below:

![Loading Starter Code](http://i.imgur.com/sXgh4Ae.png)

Note that the **Developer mode** checkbox is checked, and the
extension is enabled.

Additionally, pay close attention to the **Reload** link.

**By default, Chrome will _not_ reload your extension
automatically if you update your code. Thus, if you want to test
your extension, you _must_ reload the extension before testing.
Otherwise, your changes will _not_ be present in the active
extension.** Basically, every time you make a change to your code
that you want to test live in Chrome, make sure to reload the
extension using that **Reload** button.

## <a id="cal-to-butt">1. Cal to Butt</a>



With all that out of the way, let's get started!

Before you begin writing any code, read through the starter code
and comments we've provided. In particular, read all of
`src/inject/inject.js`, because you will be making most of your
changes in that file.

For the first task, you will update the `modifyText` function in
`src/inject/inject.js` to replace every instance of the substring
'cal' with the string 'butt' in a given word and return the
modified string. For Part 1, the `settings` variable will be null.

For example, `modifyText('calhacks organizer', null)` should
return `butthacks organizer`.

```js
/* File src/inject/inject.js */
function modifyText(text, settings) {
	// YOUR CODE HERE
	return text;
}
```

Test your method by visiting the [UC Berkeley Wiki page][ucb]
or the [CalHacks website][calhacks]. I personally like the
[Calculus Wiki page][calc-wiki].

(Hint: Check out the documentation on [JavaScript String
replace](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp)).

**Edge cases:** What happens to the string `'iCalendar'`? Try to
update `modifyText` so that it respects the original case of the
substring `cal`. That is, `'cal' -> 'butt'`, but also `'Cal' ->
'Butt'` and `'CAL' -> 'BUTT'`. What other common casing schemes
will your function account for?

## <a id="translations">2. Custom Translations</a>



We're not the first to think of this. If you read XKCD, some of
this may seem familiar to you. If you haven't read XKCD, well,
it's time to take a coding break and read some [good old-fashioned
webcomics][xkcd]. Here are a few of our favorites.

---

![Batman](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/batman.png)

---

![s/keyboard/leopard](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/s_keyboard_leopard.png)

---

![XKCD Substitutions](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/substitutions.png)

---

![Horse](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/horse.png)

---

![Substitutions 2](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/substitutions_2.png)

---

These comics show some great text replacements, which are 
reproduced here in plaintext format.

```
batman -> a man dressed like a bat

keyboard -> leopard

witnesses -> these dudes i know
allegedly -> kinda probably
new study -> tumblr post
rebuild -> avenge
space -> spaaace
google glass -> virtual boy
smartphone -> pokedex
electric -> atomic
senator -> elf-lord
car -> cat
election -> eating contest
congressional leaders -> river spirits
homeland security -> homestar runner
could not be reached for comment -> is guilty and everyone knows it

force -> horse

debate -> dance-off
self driving -> uncontrollably swerving
poll -> psychic reading
candidate -> airbender
drone -> dog
vows to -> probably won't
at large -> very large
successfully -> suddenly
expands -> physically expands
first-degree -> friggin' awful
second-degree -> friggin' awful
third-degree -> friggin' awful
an unknown number -> like hundreds
front runner -> blade runner
global -> spherical
years -> minutes
minutes -> years
no indication -> lots of signs
urgedrestraint by -> drunkenly egged on
horsepower -> tons of horsemeat
```

And of course, our very own

```
cal -> butt
```

We're going to use this "arrow syntax" to represent a text
replacement rule for the rest of this project. In particular,
we'll let

```
pattern -> replacement
```

represent the transformation from the string `"pattern"` to the
string `"replacement"`. For example, `years -> minutes` means that
we replace every instance of the substring `"years"` with the
string `"minutes"`, and `minutes -> years` means that we replace
every instance of the substring `"minutes"` with the string
`"years"`.

#### Parsing a list of strings into a map of replacement rules



For this task, you will write the function `parseSettings` in `src/inject/inject.js` to convert an input array of lines representing replacement rules and output a map from patterns to their replacements.

The function signature is

```js
function parseSettings(lines) {
    // YOUR CODE HERE
	return null;
}
```

For example,

```js
parseSettings([
  "batman -> a man dressed like a bat",
  "keyboard -> leopard",
  "force -> horse"
])
```
should return

```js
{ 
   "batman": "a man dressed like a bat",
   "keyboard": "leopard",
   "force": "horse"
}
```

You are guaranteed that each entry in the array of lines contains
the substring `'->'` at least once.

**Edge cases:** How does your function process the line `a -> b
-> c`? Does it turn it into `"a": "b -> c"`, into `"a -> b":
"c"`, or something else? What if there is no pattern (i.e. the
line looks like `-> word` with no text before the arrow)? What
if there is no replacement (i.e. the line looks like `word ->`
with no text after the arrow)? What about the line with just 2
characters, `->` (i.e. no text before or after the arrow)? How
does your function handle whitespace? Does it process the line
`" a -> b "` as `"a":"b"` or as `" a ": " b "`? What happens if
there are two different lines, each with the same pattern? For
example, perhaps one line of the array is `force -> horse` and
another entry is `force -> fore`.

#### Using a map of replacement rules to perform several text replacements



Having completed the `parseSettings` function, we now need to go
back to the `modifyText` function to use our new replacement
rules! The starter code will take the return value of your
`parseSettings` function and pass it into the `modifyText`
function as the `settings` variable.

For this task, you'll need to update `modifyText` in
`src/inject/inject.js`, so that all replacement rules from the map
are enacted.

For example, if the map contains an association between `force`
and `horse` (i.e. `settings["force"] = "horse"`), then any
instance of the substring `"force"` should be replaced by the
string `"horse"` in the text, and so on for the rest of the
`pattern: replacement` pairs in the map. As always, you should
still be replacing `"cal"` with `"butt"`.

**Edge cases:** What order are replacements evaluated in? Suppose
`settings = {'train':'bus', 'use':'eat'}`. What happens to the
string `"trainer"`? Does `train` apply first, leading to `buser`
and then `beatr`? Or does `use` apply first (with no effect),
followed by `train` for a final string of `buser`? Like in
the first "iCalendar" example, how do you handle the case of the
original text? Is there a general way to respect the original case?

#### Using the browser action



In order to test this function, we've provided you with a browser
action for the extension. In the upper right-hand corner of the
Chrome window, there will be a small TreeHacks icon.

![Browser Action Icon](http://i.imgur.com/pADUqSI.png)

Click on the icon to reveal a UI where you can enter replacement
rules. The replacement rules that you enter will be passed into
your functions and applied to the page. A screenshot of this is
shown below:

![Browser Action](http://i.imgur.com/xIAZQG8.png)

The text you enter in this box is persistent - it won't disappear
when you close the popup. If you're interested, the code for doing
this is in `src/browser_action/`. Hitting the save button saves
the text to Chrome's local storage, and hitting the clear button
clears the local storage.

## <a id="image">3. Image Replacement</a>



Last, you will extend the functionality of the extension to allow
the user to specify image replacements, just like text
replacements.

Since this is the final part of the guide, we're giving you a
little less guidance and a little more freedom here. You can use
whatever encoding scheme you want to represent image translation
rules. We suggest that you use the scheme
`img -> https://path.to/image.png` to indicate that all images
should be replaced by the image at `https://path.to/image.png`.
Depending on how you choose to represent your image replacement
rules, you may have separate steps than those below.

#### Find all images on a given webpage



If we want to replace all images on a webpage, we'll first need to
have all the images on that webpage. Write a (helper) method that
returns a list of all images on a page.

You may be tempted to use jQuery, but be warned - incorporating
jQuery into a Chrome extension isn't easy, and there's a way to
solve this using vanilla JS. If you need a hint, check out the
[documentation][querySelectorAll] for `querySelectorAll`.

#### Update `parseSettings` to handle image replacement rules in addition to text replacement rules



You'll need to change the implementation of `parseSettings` to
look out for image replacement rule(s). How will you represent an
image replacement rule? 

#### Update the source of each image on the page



Once you have the images and the replacement URL, write code to
update the original image so that it displays the target URL. If
you need a hint, look at the `src` attribute on images.

#### We're All in This Together



With these helper methods in hand, implement the
`replaceAllImages` function in `src/inject/inject.js`. This
function is called immediately after text replacements are
evaluated. If all goes well, you should be able to enter an image
replacement rule into the browser action, and see that all images
are replaced!

## <a id="extra">Congratulations!</a>



You did it! Very well done. You've built a cool chrome extension
that replaces content on websites, and what's more, you get to
keep it!

At a high-level, you've built a system that relies on message
passing between a popup dialog (Chrome's browser action) and a
script that runs on every webpage. We've been using this to pass
information about text and image replacements to the injection
script, but there's no reason we have to stop there!

You can extend this framework to build really cool projects. The
sky's the limit, but we've given some suggestions here.

* Match more than just plain text - match regular expressions!
Extend the functionality of `modifyText` to treat the patterns
from `settings` as representing regular expressions, not just
plain text.
* Support matching on document selectors from the DOM. Match on
tag names (like `img`, but also `a` and `iframe`), or `.class`
names, or maybe even `#id`s. Can you build support for the
[full set][selectors] of selectors?
* Don't replace all images - just replace a few (say, 1%). Could
you change youtube links (`a` tags with an `href` containing
`"youtube"`) to Rick Astley videos?

Moving away from the realm of replacements,

* Allow the user to signal information to the background script.
Perhaps ask them for their name, and highlight in red any text
that contains their name.
* Let the user specify a bunch of servers to act as proxies.
You've built a basic Tor!
* Allow a user to input their health data, and suggest (via
friendly popup or redirect) that they exercise every period of
time they spend browsing one site (*cough* reddit *cough*).

This is just the beginning. Let your imagination run wild. We
can't wait to see what you build!
