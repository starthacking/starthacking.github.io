# How To Set Up Your Environment! 
Fun Fact: You need software to make software. Who would have thought. This guide will help you prep your computer such that you can build awesome software ~


# Python

Python is a really cool programming language thatâ€™s super easy to learn. Weâ€™ll be using Python for most of our starting projects. Weâ€™d recommend getting a specific flavor of python called Anaconda.

You should get the Python 3 version of Anconda from: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows

Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the on screen instructions.

Make sure you check these two boxes and install it for All Users.

Alright, once anaconda is installed, you need to restart your computer.

After your computer has finished restarted, hit the start button, and type `cmd` into the search box, which should open the Command Prompt. It should look like this:

Of course itâ€™ll say the computerâ€™s username instead of my name for the file path. Now go ahead and type in `python` in the command prompt and press `ENTER`

You should now see the python command window! To exit out of this hit `Ctrl + Z` and then the `ENTER` key, which will take you back to the normal command prompt.

# Everything Else

Turns out that Anaconda, the Python distribution we just installed already comes with libraries required to get started with web development ðŸ™‚ 

Now you're all set to start hacking! Happy Coding!! ^_^
