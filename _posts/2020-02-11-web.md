In a nutshell, websites are made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

content of your web page. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and describes
how your HTML elements look on screen. They often work together to create
your page and make it pretty. Here are a few tutorials to help you get
started with HTML and CSS!
