We highly recommend watching the MIT [Missing Semester][missing-semester]
lecture video **[Version Control (Git)][ms-video]** (~1 hour) and reading the
lecture notes. Their [Resouces][ms-resources] section is also helpful,
reproduced here:

> - [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is **highly recommended reading**.
> Going through Chapters 1--5 should teach you most of what you need to use Git
> proficiently, now that you understand the data model. The later chapters have
> some interesting, advanced material.
> - [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/) is a short guide on how to recover
> from some common Git mistakes.
> - [Git for Computer
> Scientists](https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/) is a
> short explanation of Git's data model, with less pseudocode and more fancy
> diagrams than these lecture notes.
> - [Git from the Bottom Up](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/)
> is a detailed explanation of Git's implementation details beyond just the data
> model, for the curious.
> - [How to explain git in simple
> words](https://smusamashah.github.io/blog/2017/10/14/explain-git-in-simple-words)
> - [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) is a browser-based
> game that teaches you Git.

The GitHub **[Hello World activity][hello-world]** is a helpful 10-minute rundown
of how to use Git with [GitHub](https://github.com).
